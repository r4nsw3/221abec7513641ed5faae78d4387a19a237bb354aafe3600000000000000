  |   Armello is a grand swashbuckling adventure that combines three        |
  |   styles of play: the deep tactics of card games with the rich          |
  |   strategy of table top board games, combined with a character          |
  |   role-playing system.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As a hero from one of the clans of Armello, you'll quest, scheme,     |
  |   hire agents, explore, vanquish monsters, cast spells and face off     |
  |   against other players, with one ultimate end goal in mind -           |
  |   storming the palace and becoming King or Queen of Armello. The        |
  |   Kingdom of Armello is as dangerous as it is beautiful, perils,        |
  |   banes and bandits hide around every corner and a spreading            |
  |   corruption known as the Rot is leaving no creature untouched.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Update/Patch Notes: v1.0.3 (v196608)                                  |
  |   You can apply this Update on our eShop release.                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   For more than three years the quest for Armello's throne has          |
  |   expanded and evolved, but it's this year that Armello receives its    |
  |   biggest update yet; v2.0. In the lead up to this epic milestone       |
  |   we'll be rolling out free updates and events faster than ever before  |
  |   and you're invited on the journey.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Hello Adventurers!                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Hope you're all well, how's the family? We're kicking off the         |
  |   feature reveals for the March update here and now so get hyped.       |
  |   The first of the four features coming in this update is New Amulets.  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Now I know you want these immediately, but only the worthy can grasp  |
  |   them. They each have their own challenging unlock criteria.           |
  |   It's time to master either the Wyld and the Rot, friends.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Harmonise: Complete a Spirit Stone Victory with a Hero from 4 unique  |
  |   Clans.                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Decay: Complete a Rot Victory with a Hero from 4 unique Clans.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   PLEASE NOTE: If you have already completed this criteria, you will    |
  |   have to undertake it again if you've got the guts.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Fun fact, both of these were inspired by community suggestion.        |
  |   Your words do not fall on closed ears. Keep your eyes to the          |
  |   horizon, as large, shiny features approach.                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   What else could be on the way?                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Hi folks!                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Here is the second feature reveal for the upcoming March Update.      |
  |   If you missed it, you might be happy to hear that we'll be running a  |
  |   Beta for this update beginning Friday the 16th, with the full launch  |
  |   scheduled for the 21st.                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The third Armello Novella is landing in this update and it features   |
  |   Amber, The Far Seeker. Dig deep enough into this tale and you may     |
  |   recognise some other familiar characters and names.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Howdy!                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Are you ready for a big one? This is the third feature reveal, and    |
  |   it is a big ol' new collection by the name of Skeeve's Curiosities.   |
  |   This new collection will be introduced as part of the March update    |
  |   on the 21st.                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   That means the Rites of Ruin collection will be cycling out, so grab  |
  |   as many Dire Chests and Dire Keys as you can. Skeeve's Curiosities    |
  |   will not be available in the beta, instead there will be double drops |
  |   of the Rites of Ruin collection.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Here's a preview of just a few of the beautiful dice that you can     |
  |   expect to find in Skeeve's Curiosities.                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Greetings one and all!                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Welcome to the fourth and final feature reveal for the March Update.  |
  |   This update in all it's glory will land on the 21st.                  |
  |   If you saw, the previous feature reveal was announcing Skeeve's       |
  |   Curiosities and we have another feature extremely relevant to this    |
  |   curious collection.                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   We've received a bunch of feedback in regards to how we manage our    |
  |   drops, and we're excited that we've been able to improve our          |
  |   transparency along with the experience on your end!                   |
